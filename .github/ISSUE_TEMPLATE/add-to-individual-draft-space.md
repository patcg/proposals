## Draft Proposal Qualifications

Does your document qualify for hosting in the Individual Draft space as outlined in https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/admin/blob/main/README.md ? Yes or No is fine here. 

## User Access

Do you wish to get access to the space for just you or for other accounts. Please list the accounts you wish to be invited to access the Individaul Drafts space. 

### Links

If your individual draft exists someplace else currently, put a link to it here. It's fine if it isn't anywhere yet.
