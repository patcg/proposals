This is the "proposals" repository of the PATCG. As a result, any documents that enter this repository should be considered as under consideration for specification work or supporting that work. Work done within this repository is therefore fully covered under the [W3C CLA](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/) for the purpose of generating documents and specifications as the standard output of PATCG. 

Documents in the repository are in one of two stages, draft or final. The presence of a proposal in this repository implies that it is at least in a draft state and under consideration by this Community Group but does not mean it has been officially set on the specification track for a final specification output. Some documents may never leave the draft state and any document will be specially marked as in its final state when it achieves that state.
