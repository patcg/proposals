# Private Advertising Technology Community Group Proposals 

This repository is where the [Private Advertising Technology CG](https://patcg.github.io/) discusses [proposals](https://patcg.github.io/charter.html#proposals) before they've been spun off into their on repository.

## Proposal workflow

### How do I propose something?

1. **Join the group.** Before making a proposal, please [join the CG](https://www.w3.org/community/patcg/join). This is to ensure that all contributions to our work are covered by the [W3C Community Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/).
2. **State your problem and make a rough proposal.** [File a new issue](https://github.com/patcg/proposals/issues/new) in which you state the problem you’re trying to address and how you propose to address it. This can be a very rough idea, or something quite a bit more fleshed out. Please be explicit about your requirements, use cases, and rationale.

### What happens next?

3. **Evaluation and refinement.** As a community, we’ll discuss your proposal in the issue you raise. The Chairs may ask you to write up and iterate on an [explainer](https://github.com/w3ctag/tag.w3.org/blob/main/explainers/index.md). They'll help you spin up a repository for your explainer (and, eventually, your spec) to live in.
4. **Adoption as a work item.** When your proposal is sufficiently fleshed out and you and the chairs agree, the group may formally adopt your proposal as a work item. This is when the group starts to work on a spec in parallel to the explainer.

### Work Process

With the approval of the chairs and group, documents may enter this repository for evaluation and refinement as part of the process of working on proposals and getting them adopted. In order to support this process, please create the applicable new documents in their own folder so that each document in progress has a folder in this repository. In doing so these documents become governed by the [W3C Community License Agreement (CLA)](https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/cla/).

Once a document is in the repository, it and its author will have access to the resources of the group to manage [ad-hoc meetings](https://github.com/patcg/meetings/issues/new?assignees=AramZS%2C+seanturner&labels=ad-hoc%3F&template=ad-hoc-meeting-template.md&title=Request+for+an+Ad-Hoc+Meeting+On%3A+) through the [meetings repository](https://github.com/patcg/meetings) under the PATCG group and continue to generate further documentation and discussion within the group.

### Standardization

5. **Editing and iteration.** The group will iterate on the spec and explainer. We’ll discuss the idea, raise issues on it, hammer out the details, and consider feedback from any implementers who prototype the feature.
6. **Migration to the standards track.** When the work item is ready for standardization, we’ll migrate it from the CG to the most appropriate standards body (e.g. [WebAppSec](https://www.w3.org/2011/webappsec/), the [WHATWG](https://whatwg.org/) or elsewhere).

## Code of Conduct

As a W3C Community Group, all work and communication within the Private Advertising Technology CG is covered by the [W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/).
